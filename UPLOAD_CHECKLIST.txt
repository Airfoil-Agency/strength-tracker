✅ FRESH START - CORRECTED FILE UPLOAD CHECKLIST
================================================

Follow these steps exactly to get your app working!

📋 STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS:

□ STEP 1: Delete old files from GitHub (if any remain)
  - Go to github.com/[your-username]/strength-tracker
  - Delete each file one by one (click file → three dots → delete)
  - Keep README.md (it's okay to leave it)

□ STEP 2: Download the CORRECTED files
  - Download these NEW corrected files I've created
  - They have the proper naming and configurations

□ STEP 3: Save files to your iPad
  - Save all files to Documents folder
  - Keep them together in one folder

□ STEP 4: Upload to GitHub
  - In your repository: "Add file" → "Upload files"
  - Upload ALL these files at once:

    ✅ index.html (THIS IS THE NEW NAME - was strength-tracker-enhanced.html)
    ✅ manifest.json (UPDATED VERSION)
    ✅ sw.js (UPDATED VERSION)
    ✅ icon-192.png
    ✅ icon-512.png
    ✅ icon.svg
    
  - Scroll down, click "Commit changes"

□ STEP 5: Wait for GitHub Pages to build
  - Wait 2-3 minutes
  - Go to Settings → Pages
  - Should show: "Your site is live at https://[username].github.io/strength-tracker/"

□ STEP 6: Test in Safari
  - Open Safari on iPad
  - Go to: https://[your-username].github.io/strength-tracker/
  - You should see your Strength Tracker app!
  - NOT just text saying "strength-tracker"

□ STEP 7: Install on Home Screen
  - If app loads correctly, tap Share button (□↑)
  - "Add to Home Screen"
  - Tap "Add"
  - Done! 🎉


🔍 WHAT CHANGED IN THE CORRECTED FILES:

1. HTML file renamed: index.html
   - GitHub Pages looks for index.html as the main page
   
2. manifest.json updated:
   - Now points to index.html instead of strength-tracker-enhanced.html
   
3. sw.js updated:
   - Service worker now caches index.html


⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:

❌ Don't upload strength-tracker-enhanced.html - use index.html
❌ Don't mix old and new versions of files
❌ Don't forget to wait 2-3 minutes after uploading
❌ Don't skip testing in Safari before installing


📦 FILES YOU NEED (with new names):

Essential files:
✅ index.html (39K) - MAIN APP FILE
✅ manifest.json (644 bytes) - UPDATED
✅ sw.js (1.1K) - UPDATED  
✅ icon-192.png (622 bytes)
✅ icon-512.png (2K)
✅ icon.svg (1.2K)

Optional (documentation):
- INSTALLATION_GUIDE.txt
- README.txt


🎯 FINAL CHECK:

After uploading, your repository should contain:
□ index.html (NOT strength-tracker-enhanced.html)
□ manifest.json
□ sw.js
□ icon-192.png
□ icon-512.png
□ icon.svg
□ README.md (GitHub's default - leave it)


💡 IF IT STILL SHOWS JUST TEXT:

- Make sure you uploaded index.html (not strength-tracker-enhanced.html)
- Wait full 3 minutes after upload
- Try hard refresh in Safari (hold reload button)
- Check Settings → Pages shows site is live
- Clear Safari cache and try again


🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING:

Problem: Repository shows strength-tracker-enhanced.html
→ Delete it and upload index.html instead

Problem: "Your site is published" but still shows text
→ Wait 3 more minutes, GitHub Pages can be slow

Problem: 404 error
→ Check Settings → Pages shows correct branch (main/master)

Problem: App loads but icon doesn't work
→ Make sure all icon files uploaded
