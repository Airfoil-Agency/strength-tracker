## NEW SECTIONS ADDED TO PROGRESS TAB:

---

## HOW IT WORKS:

### Adding a Goal:
1. Go to Progress tab
2. Scroll to "Add New Goal" section
3. Select an exercise from the dropdown
4. Enter your goal (e.g., 225 for Bench Press)
5. Click "Add Goal"
6. Goal appears in "Your Custom Goals" section above

### Tracking Progress:
- The app automatically tracks your best performance for each exercise
- "Current best" = highest weight or longest time you've logged
- Only counts workouts where you actually performed the exercise with weight/time > 0
- Progress bar updates automatically after each completed workout

### Deleting a Goal:
- Click the "Delete" button on any goal
- Confirm deletion
- Goal is removed immediately
- You can add a new goal for that exercise anytime

## TECHNICAL DETAILS:

### Data Storage:
- Custom goals saved to localStorage
- Goals persist across sessions
- No data sent to any server (100% local)
- Goals backed up with workout data

### Smart Exercise Detection:
- Automatically detects "Plank" as time-based exercise
- Shows "seconds" unit for Plank, "lbs" for all others
- Validates input (must be positive number)
- Prevents duplicate goals for same exercise

### Progress Calculation:
- Searches all completed workouts
- Finds highest weight/time for the exercise
- Calculates percentage: (current ÷ target) × 100
- Caps at 100% (no overflow if you exceed goal)

✅ Existing goal circles (Bench 225, Squat 300) - Still there
✅ Heaviest Lifts section - NO CHANGES
